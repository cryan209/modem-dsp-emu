 * describes ("a 14-bit address and 1-bit destination type"): 0 selects the
 * 24-bit program memory, 1 selects the 16-bit data memory.
 *
 * Three independent facts in the shipping Eicon firmware fix this polarity:
 *
 *  - the host-port helpers (te_dmlt.pm 0x80082950 write / 0x80082920 read)
 *    use the two-access form for addresses *below* 0x4000 and a single
 *    access at or above it (both use `bnel`/`beqz` on `addr < 0x4000`), and
 *    a 24-bit PM word is exactly what needs two 16-bit accesses.  The
 *    unconditional 24-bit accessors at 0x80082974 / 0x80082994 confirm the
 *    two-access form is `(hi << 8) | (lo & 0xff)`.
 *  - the symbol resolver (0x800a6204) adds 0x4000 when the target memory
 *    block's `memory_type & 1` is clear, and the combifile memory-block
 *    tables give type 0 to the DM blocks (kernel block 0 @0x0000, block 2
 *    @0x2f80) and type 1 to the PM blocks (block 1 @0x0900, block 3
 *    @0x0580).  So DM gets the flag, PM does not.
 *  - the same resolver's fixed-segment path adds 0x4000 for segments 0 and
 *    2 and not for 1 and 3, matching those blocks' DM/PM split.
 *
 * A previous revision had this inverted, which is why a single PM write
 * needed a commit-on-address-change workaround to make the DSP presence
 * check pass: the check writes DM, and DM needs no workaround.

     * leak two words, the 16-word PC stack saturates within ~25 frames, and
     * from then on pushes are dropped and DO loops return through unrelated
     * callers (PM 0x1749, 0x177a, 0x3f79 all overflowed this way).
     *
     * Those frames exist only because the call was synthesised, so unwind
     * them: if the core is idle and the sentinel this function pushed last
     * time is still sitting at the depth it was pushed at, the whole call was
     * abandoned and everything from there up is dead. The loop, counter and
     * status stacks are unwound with it, since a DO loop or CNTR the
     * abandoned path pushed is dead for the same reason. This is the
     * across-calls form of the save/restore adsp2181_sport1_frame() already
     * does around its own injected continuation.
     *
     * The guard is deliberately narrow: nothing happens unless the core
     * idled, and nothing happens if the firmware unwound past that depth by
     * itself, which is the ordinary case and what the PRI task does. */
